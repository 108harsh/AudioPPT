# HTML <audio> Tag Demo 🎧

This repository contains a `demo.html` file demonstrating the use of the HTML5 `<audio>` tag.

*This project was made as a first step into using GitHub.*

## 🚀 How to Use

This demo **does not include an audio file**. You must provide your own.

1.  **Add your audio file** (e.g., `audio.mp3`) to this project's folder.
2.  **Open `demo.html`** in a text editor.
3.  **Find the `<audio>` tag** and update its `src` attribute to the name or path of your audio file.

**Example:**
If your file is named `myaudio.mp3` and is in the same folder, your tag should look like this:
```html
<audio controls src="myaudio.mp3"></audio>
